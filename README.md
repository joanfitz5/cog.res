Code used to create the GWAS-by-subtraction of Resilience , and for follow-up analyses.

1. Generation of initial GWAS of EY + Res and EY/NonRES and EY and RT for futher analysis (Generation_of_GWAS.sh)
2. Code for GWAS-by-Subtration (GWAS-by-subtraction.sh)
3. Calculation of sample size after GWAS-by-Subtration
4. Conditional analysis 
5. FINMAP
6. Drawing Venn diagram
